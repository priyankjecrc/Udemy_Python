
## Polymorphism - The ability to define a generic behaviour that will behave differently when applied to different types
## A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics.
## Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
## Python is very polymorphic in nature eg - When we iterate over collection, object just needs to support iterable protocol
## and it doesn't matters if it is a tuple, dictionary, list etc ie it doesn't care about underlying tyoe

### Better watch udemy video - As there are some talks about special methods

### Method overriding or function overloading is a type of polymorphism in which we can define a number of methods with the
### same name but with a different number of parameters as well as parameters can be of different types.
### These methods can perform a similar or different function.
