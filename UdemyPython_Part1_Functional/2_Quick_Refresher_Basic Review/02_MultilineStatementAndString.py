## When we write code over multiple lines, python internally combines all the lines into one line
## Multiple Lines are not implicitly converted into a single logical line
## \ -> we can't use comment after this.. if 5>4..if this has to be done in multiple line, then check following

if 5\
        >4:
    print('great')
